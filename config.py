INSTRUCTIONS = """Controls
- Maneuver Ship with W,A,S,D
- Aim with mouse and crosshairs
- Left Mouse Button Fires Bubbles
- Space Bar cycles available colors
- Right click to speed out the next row
- p to pause game
- r to restart game

Gameplay
- Fire bubbles to make rows and columns of
  4 consecutive bubbles of the same color.
- Maneuver your ship to avoid all Bubbles.
- Bubbles creeping downward will destroy your ship on contact.
- Falling bubbles which strike your ship will cause it to grow.

Scoring
- Awarded points scale exponentially with the number
  of bubbles popped in a single combo. Bubbles created
  by player bullets do not score points.
- You cannot score more points than required to reach
  the next level with a combo.
- Points are awarded for any falling bubbles
  which do not strike the player's vessel.
- Points are deducted for any bullets which fly out of bounds.
